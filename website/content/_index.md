story:
  heading: "Built for the AI era"
  body: "Agentic coding tools run for minutes at a time. While they think, developers reach for their phone — social media, news, anything. They come back to a finished implementation with less focus than when they left."
  cta: "ArithmeGo fills that gap. Instead of scrolling, run a quick round. Sharpen the mental math skills you stopped using. Stay in your terminal, stay focused, and come back to your code with a warmer brain."
